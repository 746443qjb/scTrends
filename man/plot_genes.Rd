\title{Plot selected genes along pseudotime}
\usage{
plot_genes(bin_means, x, genes, color = NULL, alpha = 0.3, size = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{bin_means}{A numeric matrix of bin-averaged expression values
with genes in rows and pseudotime bins in columns. Row names must
correspond to gene identifiers.}

\item{x}{Numeric vector of pseudotime coordinates corresponding to
the columns of \code{bin_means}.}

\item{genes}{Character vector of gene names to plot. All genes must
be present in the row names of \code{bin_means}.}

\item{color}{Optional color specification for genes. Can be:
\itemize{
\item \code{NULL} (default): a simple default palette is used;
\item a character vector of colors with length \eqn{\ge} number of genes;
\item a named character vector whose names match gene IDs, in which
case colors are matched by gene name.
}}

\item{alpha}{Numeric transparency level for the lines (0–1).}

\item{size}{Numeric line width for the gene trajectories.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object showing the trajectories of the selected genes
along pseudotime. Users are encouraged to add their own themes,
labels, and coordinate settings.
}
\description{
\code{plot_genes()} visualizes the pseudotime trajectories of one or more
user-specified genes based on a bin-averaged expression matrix
(e.g. \code{scBin()} output). Each gene is plotted as a separate line,
with distinct colors and shared x-axis (pseudotime).

This function is intentionally style-light: it only defines the core
layers (lines and colors) and returns a \code{ggplot} object that can be
further customized with themes, labels, coordinate limits, etc.

  # Suppose you have:
  #   sb     <- scBin(seurat_obj, pseudotime_col = "pseudotime")
  #   genes  <- c("WT1", "NPHS1", "NPHS2")

  p <- plot_genes(
    bin_means = sb$bin_means,
    x         = sb$x,
    genes     = genes
  ) +
    ggplot2::labs(
      x = "Pseudotime (0 = Early, 1 = Late)",
      y = "Expression level"
    ) +
    ggplot2::theme_minimal()
